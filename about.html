                I am Ali Pourfatehian, a Bachelor of Science graduate from Capilano University in North Vancouver, BC, with a specialization in Organic chemistry, particularly synthetic organic chemistry.<br><br>
                During my time at Capilano University, I actively engaged in independent research under the supervision of Dr. Vaughan, analyzing honey samples from the Squamish region for potential contamination. Additionally, I have worked as a laboratory technician in the university's chemistry department, gaining valuable hands-on experience in laboratory management and analytical techniques.<br><br>
                My graduating project focuses on Piperonal, an aromatic aldehyde belonging to the Benzodioxole family of compounds. The objective of this research is to perform reductive amination on piperonal to synthesize a series of amines, followed by acylation of these amines. While many of the intermediate and final products in this process are well-documented, some are novel compounds. The purification and characterization of these compounds through chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques contribute to the expanding body of knowledge in organic chemistry, making this research both promising and exciting.<br><br>
                Through my education, research, and work experience, I have developed both theoretical knowledge and practical expertise in synthetic organic chemistry, as well as proficiency in analytical techniques such as NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, GC-MS, and atomic absorption spectroscopy.<br><br>
                Beyond academics, I find balance by immersing myself in nature through hiking and kayaking.<br><br>
                Looking ahead, I aspire to pursue graduate studies, with the goal of joining research groups specializing in synthetic and medicinal organic chemistry. Ultimately, I hope to contribute to the scientific community as an educator, much like the instructors who have inspired me. Teaching at an institution like Capilano University remains a long-term ambition.<br><br>
                In the meantime, I invite you to explore my Projects page to learn more about my research and work completed at Capilano University.
